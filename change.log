1.1.6+
- now it's not only non-sowable, but also non-yielding plants that are considered to be "not destroyaed when consumed";

1.1.6
- instead of changing vanilla values, made so any non-sowable plants considered to be "not destroyaed when consumed";

1.1.5
- updated for 1.2;

1.1.4
- fixed and made a reset for consumption chance being 500% at a start. Sorry about that;

1.1.3
- officially added Harmony dependency;
- added a slider for consumption chance that destroys plant. Works when plant is completely depleted and only for those plants that don't have yield, i.e. doesn't affect plants like wild berry bushes (default 5%);
- added a slider, how much damage crops receive when animals eat them based on total possible yield. By default it's 200% (it means plant dies before animals even eat all accessible yield, in order to make feeding animals this way unattractive);

1.1.2
- re-did assemblies to suit the Rimword 1.1! Hoorah!

1.1.1
- added a slider that modifies a nutrition multiplier for plants that don't have yield (so, basically grass). For those of you that aren't satisfied with persistence alone. Look for it in mod settings.

1.1
- did a rework. Removed hidden yield. Base nutrien value of a plant is used instead (as it is normally), and animals reduce growing progress of a plant;
- left one change to vanilla grass: it can be eaten as soon as it's 40% grown, it's marked as "not destroyed after consumption" (like berry bushes).

1.0.2
- removed "sowable" restrictions;

1.0.1
- plants with high growth rate regenerate faster.

1.0.0
- animals now can eat yield from growing plants with 50% efficiancy. They eat as much as they need to be satisfied;
- instead of destroying plants with possible yield right away, animals damage them instead, based on how much they ate (i.e. big animals still can one shot plants);
- plants slowly regenerate. Not very useful for short living plants, though;

0.0.0
- uh oh;
