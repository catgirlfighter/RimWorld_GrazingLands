- removed "sowable" restrictions;

1.0.1
- plants with high growth rate regenerate faster.

1.0.0
- animals now can eat yield from growing plants with 50% efficiancy. They eat as much as they need to be satisfied;
- instead of destroying plants with possible yield right away, animals damage them instead, based on how much they ate (i.e. big animals still can one shot plants);
- plants slowly regenerate. Not very useful for short living plants, though;

0.0.0
- uh oh;
