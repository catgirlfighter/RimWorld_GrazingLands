1.1.2
- re-did assemblies to suit the Rimword 1.1! Hoorah!

1.1.1
- added a slider that modifies a nutrition multiplier for plants that don't have yield (so, basically grass). For those of you that aren't satisfied with persistence alone. Look for it in mod settings.

1.1
- did a rework. Removed hidden yield. Base nutrien value of a plant is used instead (as it is normally), and animals reduce growing progress of a plant;
- left one change to vanilla grass: it can be eaten as soon as it's 40% grown, it's marked as "not destroyed after consumption" (like berry bushes).

1.0.2
- removed "sowable" restrictions;

1.0.1
- plants with high growth rate regenerate faster.

1.0.0
- animals now can eat yield from growing plants with 50% efficiancy. They eat as much as they need to be satisfied;
- instead of destroying plants with possible yield right away, animals damage them instead, based on how much they ate (i.e. big animals still can one shot plants);
- plants slowly regenerate. Not very useful for short living plants, though;

0.0.0
- uh oh;
